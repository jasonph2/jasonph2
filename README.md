## About Me 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Master's of Science in Computer Science through Georgia Tech as well as working on a personal project to improve my conversational Polish through a full-stack project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking Advanced Operating Systems and High Performance Computing at Georgia Tech as well as improving my skills in the implementation of third party libraries and APIs.  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that involves data base creation for BEP-20 cryptocurrencies.
