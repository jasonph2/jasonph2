## About Me 
- I’m currently working on my Master's of Science in Computer Science through Georgia Institute of Technology as well as working on a personal project to improve my conversational Polish through a full-stack project.
- Presently, I am taking System Issues in Cloud Computing, Computer Networks, and Military Simulation through Georgia Tech. 
- Ask me about any of my projects that you may find interesting!
- How to reach me: jphironimus@gmail.com

Languages: Python, C, C++, JavaScript, SQL

In addition, I have a school work repository that showcases some of the projects I have done during my Master's through Georgia Tech. If you are an employer and interested in a private link, you can reach me by my above email. Here is a description of some of the classwork that one can find in this repository:
Systems Issues in Cloud Computing:
- Software Defined Networking- I wrote controller code that implemented OpenFlow rules that was adaptive to topology changes. Utilizing osken (formerly Ryu), I developed controller code that implemented a shortest path algorithm that was based on latency, and a widest path algorithm based on the bandwidth of the links in the network. In addition, I built out a test suite using Mininet to effectively test these controllers.
Advanced Operating Systems:
- VM CPU scheduler and Memory Coordinator- I implemented a vCPU scheduler and a memory coordinator to make dynamic allocations to guest machines. This management came in the form of statistic collection in a host machine's user space for each guest and making corresponding hypervisor calls to balance CPU utilization and memory allocation. This was done in C utilizing libvirt and testing using Azure.
- Barrier Synchronization Algorithms- I utilized OpenMP and MPI in C to implement several different barrier synchronization concepts.
- MapReduce- Utilizing a multithreaded grpc server/client, I implemented MapReduce infrastructure in C++.
High Performance Computing:
- MPI Collectives implementation- Using MPI's basic send/recv functions I implemented a plethora of collective operations such as reduce, gather etc. These were then tested on the Georgia Tech cluster to ensure proper efficiency.
- Terasort- I implemented a distributed sorting algorithm in C using MPI's collective operations. This terasort operation was then compared to classmate's implementations on the Georgia Tech cluster.
Machine Learning for Trading:
- Martingale- I implemented a Martingale roulette strategy with experimentation utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation
- Assess Learners- I implemented a Decision Tree Learner, a Random Tree Learner, and a Bag Learner. I then experimented with each learner to observe the effects of learner choice and leaf size on overfitting and effectiveness.
- Strategy Evaluation- Utilizing a Bag Learner and a Random Tree Learner, I created a strategy learner that utilized different technical indicators to make predictions on stock price movement through hyperparameter tuning.
