## About Me 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on continuing to expand my current project of algorithmic development of cyrptocurrency markets. With the system fully up and functioning, I am striving to make the system more profitable by writing more sophisticated algorithms based on price data that I have collected.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Algorithms and Data Structures in C++ as well as practicing expanding this knowledge into Python as well. I am also learning the basics of app development through a project in Android Studio through University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that involves data base creation for BEP-20 cryptocurrencies. I am looking to expand the databases that I am generating presently, and need more computing power and ideas to be able to do so. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any of my projects that you may find interesting!
